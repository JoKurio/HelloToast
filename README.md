# HelloToast
A codelab using  Constraints in Android Studio. Based on Android fundamentals, from Google Developers Training.
It's just a simple android app that implements the onClick method; the button at  the top displays a toast  message, while the one at the bottom increments the counter in the middle by 1 each time it's clicked.
To see what the app looks like, please click on the HelloToast1 and HelloToast2 png files in the repository.
