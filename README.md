# HelloToast
A codelab using  Constraints in Android Studio. Based on Android fundamentals, from Google Developers Training.
It's just a simple android app that implements the onClick method; the 'Toast' button at the top displays a toast  message, while the 'Count' button at the bottom increments the counter in the middle by 1 each time it's clicked.
